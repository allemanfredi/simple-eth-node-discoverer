# :telescope: simple-eth-node-discoverer

Simple implementation of [Ethereum node discovery protocol](https://eth.wiki/en/research/node-discovery-protocol). 
>  Ethereum uses a node discovery protocol that is very similar to the Kademlia protocol. Kademlia is a Distributed Hash Table for p2p networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazieres. It can create a distributed server that all peers can store and read data in a decentralized way. Ethereum uses a Kademlia-like protocol for node discovery.
